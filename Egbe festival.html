                            </div>
                            <p>The Egbe festival came to stay as a result of kingship tussle between Akogwu Omaga and Akogwu Ohinekwu, both from Idah. After series of attacks and counter-attacks, Akogwu Omaga who was a gallant warrior, decided to settle at Egume with his supporters from Idah. But no sooner than later, than Akogwu Ohinekwu took pursuit of him to this settlement. Consequently, Akogwu Omaga, being so courageous and brave a man mercilessly dealt heavy blows on the warrior of Akogwu Ohinekwu ,putting nine of them to death. This is Akogwu Omaga, the indefatigable, the invincible fighter, and the mysterious. He is said to have got some power, the source of which was unknown to his rivalries. It was a top secret.

Nonetheless, being a great lover of peace, human dignity and of life, he never wanted continuous blood-shed. So he did the vicarious thing, revealing the secret of his valour. That he could be killed only by being hit on the neck with a pestle. No iron could do it. Neither could any sword, dagger nor gun. By a pestle alone could this tiger of a warrior be defeated. That was how he brought the war to an abrupt end. This wasn't any easy decision. It meant acting a woman, losing an ambition, and above all, losing one's life for the sake of others. He was eventually killed and his head was taken to Akogwu Ohinekwu at Idah.

Though happy to have emerged victorious, Akogwu Ohinekwu ordered that his head be returneed to his people at Egume and be buried honourably in appraisal of his heroic deeds. It is in virtue of this that Egume people held Akogwu Omaga in high esteem up till today. He is most beloved of all Chiefs. The head is said to be buried in the present site of Egbe Festival Shrine. On this site are buried his successors. However, his own tomb remains ever distinct.

The festival actually began with the planting of Egbe tree on the tomb of this hero. Egbe festival therefore became an annual affair to commemorate the heroic deeds of Akogwu Omaga. Consequently, he is deified and appeased to keep watchful eyes on the land.



In preparation for the festival, hunters go on hunting expeditions, the livers and kidneys of such games go for sacrifices to the ancestors. They also make sacrifices in appeasing the god of fertility (for soil, domestic animals and women folk). This is known as An?-eche. The next and the final stage of preparation is Adale-eche (to appease the gods for this stream) after which the chief priest announces the day the festival would be celebrated. In this final stage, libations are poured at the Adale stream to push or wash away all evils from the land.

On the day of the festival, all ?m?-descendants are expected home. Farmers are forbidden from going to farm. Any defaulter would be squarely dealt with by the divinities. Special dresses are worn and everybody in Egume this day is supposed to wear a festive air.

It is believed, the festival does not only ward off evils from the land but purifies the land, ushers in peace, good health, prosperity, good harvest and fertility.

As a matter of fact, the festival itself is celebrated at Egbe forest. Ritual sacrifices are made here at the grave of each of the chiefs. Nine shrines are kept at this graveyard with that of: Akogwu Omaga being the tenth. The Egbe plant symbolizes eternity and more so, the immortality of Egume chiefs. The plants have the characteristics of withering in the dry season only to rejuvenate in the rainy season. It is in this regard that the people hold that, though Akogwu Omaga was killed and buried, his spirit still lingers. He is not dead. He has only gone to rest. This forms the basis of the strong traditional belief that the chiefs of Egume never die. And this is the more reason why they continue to look unto them for assistance.

The ceremony starts with ritual sacrifices to the departed chiefs. Goats are slaughtered. Akogwu Omaga takes one while the other goes to the father of the incumbent chief. Akogwu Omaga is given the pride of place because of his power in war. He is said to have lived a life of blood and iron. That is also why the four lineages join in sacrificing to the Akogwu before those of their fathers. After making the sacrifices, the blood is sprinkled at the bottom of the Akpa (iron-wood) beside the grave. Balls of pounded yam are also sacrificed. Tradition demands that these sacrifices are brought by the sons and daughters of the departed chiefs. But where they fail to do so, the reigning chief improvises. The ?r?g?l?wu presides over the whole ceremony using a good deal of incantations. The meat to be offered is only roasted and can be eaten by anybody who is not involved in witchcraft. It is also believed that those eating can stubbornly fill other people's stomachs for them if they keep on watching them unnecessarily.

Funeral dirges are sung and special drummers and dancers continue to keep the whole atmosphere agog until later in the day when the Abahi (Effigy) is lifted for procession to the chief's palace. This effigy symbolizes the coming home of the dead. While the procession leaves the graveyard, anybody behind the effigy is forbidden to look back. It is said that he who infringes this rule would see the late king and some old women which is a bad omen. Similarly, the reigning chief does not see the effigy. If he sees it he would die instantly.

As soon as the procession reaches the main road there is a temporary road-block until it reaches the Onu's (chief's) palace. The people continue with folk songs, funeral dirges and dances. They bear leaves in their arms adding excitement to the whole atmosphere. The youth especially, sing unique songs, running to and fro the effigy till the procession ends at dusk.

Right in front of the effigy is a sword-bearer usually the ?r?g?l?wu who displays the sword used by the hero. Inside the canopy too are two bearers of Ugba-?bo.These should be teenage girls who are virgins and are not under menstruation. The Ugba (plate) contains materials for the ceremony.

The whole day is marked with festivities. People wine and dine to their fill. The only soup accepted by custom on this day is Abaro

When the procession finally arrives in the Onu's palace, the people are later treated to a variety show of cultural activities ranging from songs and dances to displays. The chief could also make out time to address the guests, with his Gagos, Aides in attendance and other traditional Rulers in Egume. The talk could be centered on Egbe festival, its origins, meaning and significance.

An Egbe festival could turn out to be female (?ya) or male (?k?). It is said to be male when despite the whole ceremony, people experience famine, disease, accidents, death of domestic animals, poor harvest and hardships. If it is Egbe- ?ya the direct opposite holds sway, there would be plenty of food, property and fertility in the women folk. An Egbe is considered masculine, when, for instance, it rains before the procession ends and if it does not rain within the first three, seven or at most, fourteen days after the festival, in a bid to set things right, sacrifices are made at the Adale stream. </p>
